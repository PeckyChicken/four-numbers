Quad Target is your daily math puzzle game.
Each day brings 2 new puzzles. An easy one with no multiplication and a hard one requiring multiplication.

In each puzzle, you are given 4 numbers and a target. The goal is to combine the 4 numbers with the correct operations to create the target.
The UI is a simple drag-and-drop design, dragging numbers and operations into the expression box to produce an answer.
